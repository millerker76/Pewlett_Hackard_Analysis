# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
Pewlett_Hackard retirement analysis


## Overview


### Purpose

* The purpose of this project is to provide an analysis of the numbers and job titles of employees who are currently eligibile for retirement at Pewlett-Hackard.
  There are many baby-boomer age employees who will be retiring in a large wave at Pewlett-Hackard, similarly to other organizations throughout the country, 
  and the company needs to know how many employees per job title are eligible to retire.   

* In addition, there's a need for newer and younger employees to gain the knowledge and experience of the retirement-eligible staff, and management has requested that this   analysis identify employees who are eligible for mentorship opportunities.

### Data Description

Multiple csv files containing employee data were provided and loaded into tables.   Additional tables were created for the analysis.

## Deliverables

### 1.  Retirement analysis:   
 * retirement_titles.csv  - this csv file lists all the employees who are currently eligible for retirement and their current job title.
    
 * retiring_tites.csv     - this csv file shows the count of retirement eligible employees by job title.
    
 * % of employees retiring -  the chart below shows the percentage of current P-H employees who are eligible to retire.

 * We can see that nearly a third of the current workforce are eligible to retire and that many, many positions will need to be filled.  It will be important to 
    consider providing incentives to retirement-eligible employees to remain with the company a little longer in order to mentor the new employees
 
 ### 2. Mentorship analysis:
 * mentorship_eligibility.csv - this csv file lists all the employees who are eligible for a mentorship program at P-H.
    
 * mentorship_titles.csv - this csv file shows the count per job title of employees who are eligible for mentorship
    


## Summary

* This analysis has delivered a list of retirement-eligible employees and a list of mentorship-eligible employees as well as tables showing the count of each per job title.   An additional deliverable, the mentorship_titles table was produced to show the count of mentorship-eligible employees per job title.

* In addition, the analysis has shown that nearly a third of current employees are eligible to retire and a wave of hiring will be needed to replace them.   An additional table, the all_current_emps table was produced to help provide insight into number of all current employees in proportion to retirement eligible employees.

* Although there is a huge population of retirement-eligible employees who can mentor existing newer employees, as they retire, P-H risks losing a lot of 
  organizational knowledge and skill that takes years to develop.
